# Ember Brunch Scaffold Project

Surprised by the new Ember v2 Router API?  Did you think WTF?  So did we.  Here's our attempt to figure it out by building a basic application.

## Dependencies
In case you completely overlooked the title (classic Phil), this application is built with [Brunch](http://brunch.io/).  It is the only dependency needed, and therefore must be installed to build this application.
  
    npm install -g brunch

## Setup Process
After Brunch is installed, run these commands in your terminal to get started...

1. `npm install`
2. `brunch b` or `brunch w`
